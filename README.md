# Colorful Callouts for Obsidian
<div align="flex">
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=obsidian" alt="obsidian logo"/>
</div>
With just this CSS, you can change the colors of your Obsidians callouts!


Here are provided two examples I made and a [file](Template.CSS) with comments so you can make your own.

Example:
<div align="flex">
  <img src="Photo Examples/no-css.png" alt="with no CSS"/>
  <img src="Photo Examples/with-css.png" alt="with CSS"/>
  <img src="Photo Examples/ob-code.png" alt="original code"/>
</div>

If you know how to make other things for callout with just CSS, contanct me.
