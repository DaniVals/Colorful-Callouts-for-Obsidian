# Colorful Callouts for Obsidian
<div align="flex">
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=obsidian" alt="obsidian logo"/>
</div>
With just this CSS, you can change the colors of your Obsidians callouts!

## Change the color of callouts with same icon
Here are provided two examples I made and a [file](Template.CSS) with comments so you can make your own.

Example:
<div align="flex">
  <img src="Photo Examples/no-css.png" alt="with no CSS"/>
  <img src="Photo Examples/with-css.png" alt="with CSS"/>
  <img src="Photo Examples/ob-code.png" alt="original code"/>
</div>

## Add your own color
With [this CSS](Simple-Color-Callouts.css) you can add your own custom colors by just writing the color in the callout.

Example:
<div align="flex">
  <img src="Photo Examples/SCC-css.png" alt="color example"/>
  <img src="Photo Examples/SCC-code.png" alt="original code"/>
</div>
You can hide or not the pencil icon with the root var svg-opacity, but you can't change the icon for another one with just CSS.
